# room-locator-spinners
you can copy and paste the new file over, u can rename it whatever you want. In the stringxml i added a new string array so u only need to copy over the string array "buildings" into you current stringsxml if you already have the new arrays from the review feature i did sunday.
If not just copy them all in now as it is most likely the final version of it anyways. everything is already set up i believe, the only did you need to do is change the intents in the room locator java class to go to which building you want. if you need help lmk :)
